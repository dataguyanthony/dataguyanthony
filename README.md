# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony and I'm a data guy

Hey there! I'm Anthony, a passionate data guy with a knack for managing and architecting data across systems. Currently, I serve as a Manager of Business Systems, responsible for overseeing a team of developers and coordinating projects related to both front-end and back-end systems within our organization.

**Data Enthusiast**: I've always been drawn to the power of data. My journey began at an early age, mastering VB and Excel, which paved the way for my career in data analysis and reporting after college. Over the years, I've honed my skills and become an expert in SQL Server and T-SQL, allowing me to effortlessly manipulate and extract insights from diverse datasets.

**Cloud and Azure Aficionado**: I'm not just limited to traditional server environments. I feel right at home in the cloud, especially in Azure. Whether it's administering services, crafting architectural solutions, or writing CLI scripts, I thrive in the dynamic cloud landscape and leverage its capabilities to drive meaningful outcomes.

**Database Architect**: Front-end projects? I've got them covered with meticulously designed and normalized databases. Need a denormalized data warehouse for empowering Power BI? Consider it done. The art of architecting databases and transforming them into actionable insights inspires me, and I relish every opportunity to deliver robust, scalable, and efficient data solutions.

Whether it's on-premises or in the cloud, from databases to data lakes, I've tackled diverse challenges, and truth be toldâ€”I absolutely love it. So if you're looking for someone who's passionate about data, adept at managing teams, and dedicated to driving data-driven success, you've found the right person in me.
